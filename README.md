### GILTY TREASURES

A website that answers the question "what is the most expensive thing sold on Gilt.com today?" And nothing else useful.

You can view it at [http://gilty-treasures.heroku.com](http://gilty-treasures.heroku.com).

Runs just like any standard Sinatra app; built with deployment to Heroku in mind. You'll need a Gilt.com API key from the [Gilt Developer Portal](http://dev.gilt.com).
