### GILTY TREASURES

A webapp that answers the question "what is the most expensive thing sold on Gilt.com today?" And nothing else useful.

Runs just like any standard Sinatra app; built with deployment to Heroku in mind. You'll need a Gilt.com API key from the Gilt Developer Portal (URL forthcoming).
